                            Simply put, we are committed to protecting your privacy in every way, at all times. Using this Website implies your acceptance of Change for a 10’s Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. If you do not accept any aspect of the Policy, please don’t use the Website.
                            <br/><br/>
                            This Policy will help you understand what information we may ask you to provide, how we use and share that information, and how you can control the information using our website.
                            <br/><br/>
                            We will not use or share your information with anyone, except as prescribed in this Privacy Policy.

                        <div class="privacysectioncontent">
                            If you choose to create an account with us and join us in changing the world one impactful project at a time, you will be asked to provide us with your email address, and enter a secure password.
                            <br/><br/>
                            We will ask you to provide some personal information (first name, last name, email address) either as part of the sign-up process, or after you have signed up. We may also ask you to create a unique “display name” which will be viewable to the public by default, but you can make it private in the personal settings section of the website.
                            <br/><br/>
                            When you create an account with us that requires your email address, it probably won’t surprise you to hear that we may send you an email from time to time.   We’ll send you cool things like newsletters with updates on the impact your previous donations are having.  And we’ll also send you not-as-cool things like “system messages” about account information.   As you would expect, you can opt out of the cool stuff by changing the settings in your user account.  We respect your right to manage your inbox.  But we may occasionally required to send you the not-so-cool stuff about your account because it’s important for security and things like that.
                            <br/><br/>
                            At some point, you’ll be able to post comments, texts, images, videos, and other content to the Website. Any Materials you post to the Website may be viewable by the general public and are governed by our Terms of Use.  So you should read those.

                            We’ll only use the information you provide to complete your donation(s) and provide you with tools to manage and monitor your transactions. Change for a 10 is a partner nonprofit that accepts all donations that come through the Website. When you make a donation to a Change for a 10 to help fund a project we are featuring for another nonprofit, by default we will NOT share your information with that nonprofit.  However, we will make it easy for you to change that default and choose to allow Change for a 10 to pass your name, address, and email address along to the featured nonprofits you are supporting.
                            <br/><br/>
                            However, to be clear, neither Change for a 10 or our featured nonprofits will ever share your personal information, donation activity, or email address with any third party without your prior written consent.
                            <br/><br/>
                            We will use your contact information to send you information concerning your donation, including a donation confirmation and any notices about problems with your credit card.
