                <div class="privacysectioncontent">
                    To determine final rank (Winner, 2nd, 3rd), when 2 or more participants are tied at the end of the tournament with the same number of points, the tie-breakers listed below will be applied, in order, to determine who has the higher “rank”.   Some participants will be dropped from the running for a certain “rank” as the tie-breakers are applied…but they will be eligible for the next available “rank” after the tie-breaker procedure determines the participant that ultimately earns the rank for which they were disqualified.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Tie-breakers will be applied in the following order:
                    <br/>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Total points scored in the Championship game, combined score of the two teams (CLOSEST…regardless of whether you guess over or under the actual)</li>
                        <li>Total points scored in the 5th round (50 possible pts)</li>
                        <li>Total points scored in the 4th round (64 possible pts)</li>
                        <li>Total points scored in the 3rd round (64 possible pts)</li>
                        <li>Total points scored in the 2nd round (64 possible pts)</li>
                        <li>Total points scored in the 1st round (64 possible pts)</li>
                    </ol>
