                        <div class="privacysectiontitle">1. Where is my money going? Is it going to Change for a 10?  Or to the nonprofits mentioned on Change for a 10’s website?</div>
                        <div class="privacysectioncontent">
                            Your money is ultimately going to the nonprofit featured on Change for a 10’s website.  While the money does “pass through” Change for a 10 prior to the featured nonprofit receiving it, not one penny of your donation is kept by Change for a 10.  Nor do the featured nonprofits pay Change for a 10 in any way.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Change for a 10 is a registered, tax-exempt nonprofit organization.  100% of your donation is tax-deductible and Change for a 10 will issue you the appropriate receipt for your donation.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Credit card payment processors do charge between 2% and 5.5% per transaction (depending on type of card and size of donation) and that part of the donation never makes it into Change for a 10’s hands to be passed along to the featured nonprofit. These are very typical rates for credit card transactions.
                            <br/><br/>
                            So…on average, the featured nonprofit will get $9.48 of your $10 donation.  The credit card processor will keep $0.52.  And Change for a 10 will keep $0…but we will have the joy of leveraging a powerful and passionate network of caring individuals to fund high-impact projects.

                            Yes, your donation is tax-deductible within the guidelines of U.S. law. Change for a 10 has 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status with the IRS. To claim a donation as a deduction on your U.S. taxes, keep the email receipt we send you after processing your donation.

                           Change for a 10 is a registered 501(c)(3) public charity that evaluates and selects high-impact projects being run by other nonprofit organizations.  We leverage a powerful and passionate network of active donors (that’s YOU!) to fund those projects.

                            Yes, your donation must be at least $10 to be processed through Change for a 10.

                            For the Hoops to Fight Hunger event, all donations are $10 for those choosing to donate.

                            In the case of the Hoops to Fight Hunger event that we are running in March 2011, an unrestricted gift will be given to the 3 hunger-related nonprofits designated by the top 3 participants in the pool.  The funds raised through this event will be given to those nonprofits within 10 business days of the Championship game.
                            <br/><br/>
                            When we launch our project-based initiatives later this year, we will issue a grant or give a restricted gift once the project is fully funded.
